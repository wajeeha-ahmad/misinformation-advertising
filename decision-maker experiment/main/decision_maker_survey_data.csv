In my experience with the #EndSars movement and the resultant killing of the youths at the Lekki Toll gate being the venue of the final rally. Nigerians were mortified to find Facebook flagging photos and posts from that night shootings as FALSE! This bred so much distrust amongst us as to who these fact checkers really are, and called to question their integrity, as it seemed they were working for the government who were trying every means to cover up the shooting and killing of unarmed civilian youths that night, as they didn't want to take responsibility and were not ready to name who gave the military the orders to shoot and kill the youths protesting and to disperse the crowd. These are the issues. If we leave the fact checking to a few organisations, then it becomes very easy for corrupt governments and rich multinationals to use them to stifle protests and free speech.
