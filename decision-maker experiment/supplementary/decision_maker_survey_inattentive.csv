The survey comes across as showing that the project sponsors somehow believe that right minded people can and should decide what is and isn't misinformation and then should advise advertisers as to where it is and isn’t ok for them to place their ads. By causing advertisers to shun concepts not in the mainstream thinking, you can put people and entities that support contrary positions out of business. No matter how well meaning, this type of monitoring, flagging and censorship is extremely dangerous. These are the people who, during Galileo’s time, would censor anyone supporting the idea that the earth revolves around the sun, contrary to longstanding scientific and religious truth. They would deny that maybe ulcers can be treated with antibiotics instead of surgery. They would deny that maybe Covid was badly handled.

More like creating a duty of care to dispense accurate information.,"I think that the area of information regulation on the internet is tricky because the issue of trust in the so called fact checking entities that flag posts as misinformation is unresolved. In my experience with the #EndSars movement and the resultant killing of the youths at the Lekki Toll gate being the venue of the final rally. Nigerians were mortified to find Facebook flagging photos and posts from that night shootings as FALSE! This bred so much distrust amongst us as to who these fact checkers really are, and called to question their integrity, as it seemed they were working for the government who were trying every means to cover up the shooting and killing of unarmed civilian youths that night, as they didn't want to take responsibility and were not ready to name who gave the military the orders to shoot and kill the youths protesting and to disperse the crowd. These are the issues. If we leave the fact checking to a few organisations, then it becomes very easy for corrupt governments and rich multinationals to use them to stifle protests and free speech. Hence it's a delicate balance between the two.
